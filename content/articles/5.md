In this blog post, I'm going to quickly go through seven Bloggify-related projects.



### 1. [Bloggify Quick Start`](https://github.com/Bloggify/bloggify-quick-start)

This is a quick example of a Bloggify app. It comes with few example pages and articles. The default theme is [*Light*](https://github.com/BloggifyThemes/light).

You can configure the app in the `bloggify.js` file. More technical details will be posted soon.

### 2. [Custom Assets](https://github.com/Bloggify/custom-assets)

Custom Assets is a very useful plugin to insert custom resources in your app. Using it you can inject custom CSS, JavaScript and server code. You can use this for app-specific code which is not reusable in other applications (in the moment it will be reusable, you may consider publishing it as a plugin). :cloud:

### 3. [Bloggify SendGrid](https://github.com/Bloggify/bloggify-sendgrid)

`bloggify-sendgrid` is a plugin which makes it simple to send emails via SendGrid, from your Bloggify app. :email:

### 4. [Emoji](https://github.com/Bloggify/emoji)

Everybody loves emojis. :yum: They are so cute. :grin: Using the `emoji` plugin, you can add emoji in your Bloggify app (you just saw some on this page). The only thing you have to do is to install this plugin.

### 5. Plugins for databases

If you want to keep your database operations simple, you may want to use a plugin. Currently, [`bloggify-sequelize`](https://github.com/Bloggify/bloggify-sequelize) can be used to create Sequelize models and [`bloggify-mongoose`](https://github.com/Bloggify/bloggify-mongoose) for Mongoose models. :minidisc:

### 6. [Flexible Router`](https://github.com/Bloggify/flexible-router)

The `flexible-router` plugin allows you to create a solid *custom* structure of routes and controllers. :globe_with_meridians:

### 7. [GitHub Login](https://github.com/Bloggify/github-login)

This plugin can be used to add GitHub OAuth authentication to your website. :octocat:
