If yesterday we were announcing the [downloadable assets](/blog/2-bloggify-assets) (SVG and PNG images), today we're happy to introduce the Bloggify icon font you can include in the page.

Visit the [Bloggify Icons](http://icons.bloggify.org) page to see the icons and download the icon font.

----

The usage is very simple. You have to include the CSS file in your page like this:

```html
<link href="path/to/bloggify-icons.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

or if you want to include from a CSS file:

```css
@import url('path/to/bloggify-icons.css');
```

Then in the HTML, you can display the icons by using `<span>` elements:

```html
<span class="icon-bloggify-mark"></span>
```

Check out the [JSFiddle demo](https://jsfiddle.net/Bloggify/14L3htp1/).

Enjoy using the new icon font!
