Hey there! We're Bloggify and we're happy that you are here, on our website. When we say **we**, **us** or **Bloggify** it's because that's who we are. We own and run the Bloggify website.

By navigating on our websites you agree to follow the terms explained on this page. Please read and understand them.
If you don't accept them, then we'll be sorry, but you will need to leave.

### Prohibited Conduct
You promise that you will not use a false email address, fake personal information, impersonate others, or misrepresent your affiliation with others.

### Intellectual Property
Basically, we own all the Bloggify  content unless otherwise stated and excluding content owned by others. We respect the intellectual property rights of others and we expect our users to do the same. Please contact us if you think that an item or content infringes an intellectual property right.

### No Liability
You agree that we cannot be liable for your use of the website or the content that is posted on Bloggify by other users.

### Linking to us
We would be so happy if you decide to link to Bloggify from other sites but you have to link to a full version of a page and not link directly to an image or file hosted on our website.

You must not embed the Bloggify pages on other websites.

As our sites are global, there are different laws that may apply and these may restrict our relationship with you.

### Notices & Requests
Any notice you send us must be submitted to `support<at>bloggify<dot>org`. The answer will be sent back to your email address.

### Changes
We may change these terms at any time. If you continue to use the Bloggify website after the changes are made, then you will be agreeing to the changes.

### Applicable Laws
We control and operate the Bloggify from Romania. The laws of Romania govern these terms, and you submit to the jurisdiction of the courts there for the resolution of any dispute between us.

## Bloggify Market
The Bloggify Market is a place where you can buy goodies (such as JavaScript libraries, Node.js modules etc) you can integrate into your apps.

### How buying things works
In this section, we will explain how the process works when you decide to buy something on our website.

Some of the products sold on Bloggify are owned by us and some are owned by other authors. You will find that information in each product description.

What are you actually buying? When you buy something on our website, you are not acquiring the actual item, instead, you acquire the right or a license to use that item. The license is granted to you directly by the author. Make sure you understand the license type for the item you are buying. If you are letting other people use your item, make sure you choose the right license to allow that use.

The products are listed on the website. By visiting the product page you can add it to your cart. If you want to buy more items, that's possible too.

The product price is listed on the product page.

On the Checkout page, you will see the amounts for each item and the grand total. The payment is done via credit card. The payment is processed by [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com).

The currency is euro (EUR).

When you buy something, you are doing so on the following terms:

 - you promise you considered the suitability of your chosen license, and that you have chosen appropriately
 - you cannot cancel a completed purchase of an item
 - we do not promise that any particular item will continue to be available, so you should download and save the item as soon as you buy it
 - you understand that others might also buy a particular item under the same license
 - the author retains ownership of the item
 - your relevant details may be provided to the author of the item in order to facilitate the transaction (generally for invoicing and item support)
 - the billing information you provide is correct and complete

Should you encounter any problems during the buying process, feel free to contact us.

### Refunds
We do *not* grant refunds on the purchases made on this website.
