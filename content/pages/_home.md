                    <p><strong>Bloggify</strong> is simple
                        to use. With a minimalist interface,
                        you can do anything you expect
                        from a blogging platform.</p>
                    <p>If you
                        still want more, you can install and create
                        <a href="#plugins">plugins</a> easily.</p>
                    <p>Bloggify is built with love and we should keep it simple.</p>

                        The themes are another part that makes <strong>Bloggify</strong> awesome. If you are non-technical,
                        you can choose a theme you like. However, as developer, you can create a theme easily.

                    <p><strong>Bloggify</strong> has a nice
                        REST API for developers.</p>
                    <p>Using it, the developers can create
                        third-pary applications to access
                        the Bloggify resources.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bloggify</strong> is like a puzzle\: it is built from
                        multiple pieces. Each piece does one thing and does it well.</p>
                    <p>The plugin system makes Bloggify very extensible allowing you to add more custom features and change the core functionality.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bloggify</strong>'s performance
                        is awesome. Caching techniques
                        are used (both on server and client)
                        to speed up the things.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bloggify</strong>'s API
                        has built-in <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> integration.
                        This is cool when talking about
                        content.</p> All changes made by user are saved automatically
                    into a <code>git</code> repository.
                    <p>This repository can be synced with
                        a Git provider (e.g. <a href="http:/github.com">GitHub</a>),
                        so other people will be able to contribute
                        to content (e.g. fixing typos and so on).</p>
