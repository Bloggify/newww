### Information we collect
On our websites we may ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home address, or telephone number. We will always have a good reason to do that: for example, when you buy something and we have to generate an invoice for you.

### Credit Card Information
The card information is *not* stored on our side but securely sent to [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com)â€“the service which handles the credit card payments.

### Cookies & Local Storage
By navigating on our websites, you agree with storing cookies (sorry, not the chocolate ones) in your browser. As we are sure you know, cookies are used to store your preferences and other information on your computer, in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content when you visit our website later. And don't worry, cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. We will not always store cookies in your browser, but when we do we will do our best to protect your personal data.

Also, we may use local browser storage to store some data (such as cart related information).

### How do we use the personal information?

We will generate invoices, which are sent to your email address.

### When may we disclose personal information?

In special cases we may disclose the personal information to:

 - professional advisers (lawyers, accountants, financial advisers etc)
 - regulators and government authorities in connection with our compliance procedures and obligations
 - other people where we are authorised or required by law to do so

### How do we store the personal information?
You send and receive the information to/from our servers via a secure connection. The information is stored securely on servers, which are managed by us or by our service providers.

### What about links to other websites?
Our pages may contain links to other websites, which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information about you that will be used in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.
